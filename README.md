# GameProject 
This is a game project where I'm going to use my spare time for building it.

# Getting started

## Debian based distros
```console
$ sudo apt install g++ cmake liblua5.1-dev libsfml-dev
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./gameProject
```

## Windows

Current game.ps1 and editor.ps1 are being used for building the game on Windows. You will probably have to install [**Lua 5.1**](https://www.lua.org/download.html) and [**SFML**](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/). Add the libraries to your mingw, modify the include path on build files.
